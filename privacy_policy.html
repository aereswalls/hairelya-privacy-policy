  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 2, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how user data is handled in the Hairelya app. By using the app, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Hairelya does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information. All data is stored securely on your device or, if enabled, in your private iCloud account. The app does not require login or collect names, emails, or contact information.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Stored</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally on the device or in iCloud (for PRO users only), and is never shared externally. The app does not store personal information such as names or contact details.</p>

  <p>The data stored includes only user-defined app content, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hair care routine steps and preferences</li>
    <li>Hair timeline photos with optional notes</li>
    <li>List of hair care products used (name, type, brand)</li>
    <li>Reminder and scheduling preferences (e.g. “morning”, “every 3 days”)</li>
    <li>Hair profile data selected by the user (type, structure, scalp condition, goals)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. iCloud Sync</h2>
  <p>If you are a PRO user, your data is automatically synced with your personal iCloud account. Apple’s iCloud security and encryption protocols apply. We cannot access your iCloud data.</p>

  <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
  <p>The app uses local notifications to remind you about scheduled treatments or goals. No notification data is sent externally or stored on a server.</p>

  <h2>5. Ads</h2>
  <p>Hairelya FREE version may display banner ads. These are provided by third-party ad networks (such as Google AdMob) and may use anonymous identifiers for basic ad serving. No personalized ad tracking is performed by the app itself.</p>

  <h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>You can purchase a PRO subscription through Apple’s secure in-app purchase system (StoreKit). We do not store any payment information.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your data manually within the app at any time. Uninstalling the app will also remove all locally stored data. Data stored in iCloud must be deleted via the iCloud settings on your device.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be notified of any major changes within the app.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:hairelya.app@gmail.com">hairelya.app@gmail.com</a></p>
