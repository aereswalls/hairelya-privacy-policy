  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 15, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how user data is handled in the Hairelya app. By using the app, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Hairelya does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information. All app content data is stored securely on your device or, if enabled, in your private iCloud account. The app does not require login or collect names, emails, or contact information.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Stored</h2>
  <p>The following data is stored locally on your device or, for PRO users, in your iCloud account. This data is never shared externally:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hair care routine steps and preferences</li>
    <li>Hair timeline photos with optional notes</li>
    <li>List of hair care products used (name, type, brand, and optional details)</li>
    <li>Reminder and scheduling preferences</li>
    <li>Hair profile data selected by the user (type, structure, scalp condition, goals)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No personal information such as names or contact details is stored or transmitted by us.</p>

  <h2>3. iCloud Sync (PRO only)</h2>
  <p>If you are a PRO user, your data may be manually backed up or restored through your personal iCloud account. All iCloud security and encryption protocols apply. We cannot access your iCloud data.</p>

  <h2>4. Chatbot (HairelyaAI)</h2>
  <p>The Hairelya app includes an AI-powered chatbot called HairelyaAI, designed to provide general advice related to haircare. This feature is powered by OpenAI’s large language models (e.g., GPT-4).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Messages entered into the chatbot are sent to OpenAI’s servers for processing and response generation.</li>
    <li>We do not store or access these messages. Responses are generated and returned in real-time.</li>
    <li>No user identifiers or personal data are attached to these requests.</li>
    <li>Users are advised not to enter personal or sensitive information into the chatbot.</li>
    <li>For more information about OpenAI’s data practices, see their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Notifications</h2>
  <p>The app uses local notifications to remind you about scheduled treatments or goals. No notification data is sent externally or stored on any server.</p>

  <h2>6. Ads and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Hairelya FREE version may display banner and/or interstitial ads provided by third-party ad networks such as Google AdMob. These networks may use your device’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA) and cookies or similar technologies for the purposes of showing ads, measuring performance, and, with your explicit consent, serving personalized advertising.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upon first launch, the app will request your permission to track your activity across apps and websites via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</li>
    <li>No tracking or personalized advertising will occur unless you provide consent.</li>
    <li>You can change your consent at any time from iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</li>
    <li>For more details on Google’s data collection and usage, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy &amp; Terms</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect or share any user data for advertising or analytics purposes ourselves. All advertising-related data is handled by third-party partners according to their privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>7. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>You can purchase a PRO subscription through Apple’s secure in-app purchase system (StoreKit). We do not collect or store any payment information; all transactions are processed by Apple.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your data manually within the app at any time. Uninstalling the app will also remove all locally stored data. To remove data stored in iCloud, you must delete it via your iCloud account settings on your device.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Hairelya is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete such data.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
